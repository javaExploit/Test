Security Considerations
While it is usually quite easy to build software that works as expected, it is much harder to check that nobody can use it in a way that was not anticipated.

In Solidity, this is even more important because you can use smart contracts to handle tokens or, possibly, even more valuable things. Furthermore, every execution of a smart contract happens in public and, in addition to that, the source code is often available.

Of course you always have to consider emp3r0r how much is at stake: You can compare a smart contract with a web service that is open to the public (and thus, also to malicious actors) and perhaps even open source. If you only store your grocery list on that web service, you might not have to take too much care, but if you manage your bank account using that web service, you should be more careful.

This section will list some pitfalls and general security recommendations but can, of course, never be complete. Also, keep in mind that even if your smart contract code is bug-free, the compiler or the platform itself might have a bug. A list of some publicly known security-relevant bugs of the compiler can be found in the list of known bugs, which is also machine-readable. Note that there is a bug bounty program that covers the code generator of the Solidity compiler.

As always, with open source documentation, please help us extend this section (especially, some examples would not hurt)!

NOTE: In addition to the list below, you can find more security recommendations and best practices in Guy Landoâ€™s knowledge list and the Consensys GitHub repo.
